          <dl>
            <dt>What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?</dt>
            <dd><p>I used to be a lawyer and worked in project finance.</p></dd>
            <dt>What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?</dt>
            <dd><p>I had a feeling I might enjoy it so I started to play with it online and then I got to a point where I felt like I wouldn't progress more and not learn more so I looked online and found Makers Academy.</p></dd>
            <dt>What did you find difficult during the course?</dt>
            <dd><p>There is a lot to learn and it was sometimes difficult to keep on top of everything, especially knowing there was something completely new coming each week. It was challenging getting used to that feeling of not finishing things and feeling okay to move on to the next thing.</p></dd>
            <dt>What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?</dt>
            <dd><p>After graduation I chilled out for a week and took a bit of a break and then I started work on my CV and immediately after the job fair my CV started to get sent out. Very quickly after I graduated I was being encouraged to apply.  I went on the trip to Brno to take part in a recruitment hackathon and then I had a crazy week of interviews. I then started to find out I had job offers and I took several days to decide which job to take and I then accepted my job at the Financial Times.</p></dd>
            <dt>How has your life changed since graduation?</dt>
            <dd><p>My life has changed a lot because I am now in this world of coders, talking and thinking about programming all the time. It's a surprisingly active community with loads of meetups centred around different languages. It's taken over my life in a good way. I've become fully absorbed in this world of code.</p></dd>
            <dt>What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?</dt>
            <dd><p>For me Makers Academy has been the best decision ever. It took me from one career to another in a short space of time. If you are thinking of doing Makers Academy, be ready for it to take over your life, and be prepared to give it all of your energy for a few months.</p></dd>
            <dt>What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?</dt>
            <dd><p>When I was applying I did think it was expensive, but if you are thinking of studying again to change career, compare it to a masters or university course. It might seem relatively expensive because it's a short course, but conversely it’s actually better value. You start earning and making that money back again sooner than you would with a longer course.</p></dd>
            <dt>What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?</dt>
            <dd><p>It felt like a huge risk because I was diving into something I might or might not have ended up being good at. But I'm really glad I took that risk and I think Makers Academy is an incredible environment to learn in. You don't just learn to code here - you also have lots of fun and meet great people. You also have an amazing support network of expert developers, and wellbeing support.</p></dd>
            <dt>Sum up your Makers Academy experience</dt>
            <dd><p>It's intense, challenging but amazing.</p></dd>
