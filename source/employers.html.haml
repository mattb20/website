        %span Makers Academy graduates are passionate, driven, curious and engaging.
      %p They solve their own problems, are exceptionally fast and effective learners, and understand the business context beyond the code.

      %h2 What they learn
      %p 
        %span We focus on attitude first, behaviour second, and technologies third.
      %p The most important thing you learn at Makers Academy is how to confidently approach a problem you don't know the answer to, sometimes using tools you've never used before.

      %p The next most important thing you learn is the set of behaviours that support that attitude: test-driven development, pair programming and Agile development.

      %p The least important thing you learn at Makers Academy is the actual technologies. Students learn mainly Ruby and JavaScript on the course, but our graduates are language-agnostic, often getting jobs in all manner of other technologies.
