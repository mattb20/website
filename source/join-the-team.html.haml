        %span Since we started in early 2013 we grew from two people to a team of twenty.
        We have graduated over #{stats.number_of_graduates} Makers who now work at Pivotal Labs, 8th Light, Thoughtworks, New Bamboo, BSkyB, FundingCircle, the Ministry of Justice, Global Personals, Mint Digital and many other great companies. We are profitable. Our mission is to teach as many people as possible to code well through our web development coding classes.
      %p To learn, read.
      %p To know, write.
      %p To master, coach.
