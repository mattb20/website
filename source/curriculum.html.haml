      %h1 Curriculum
      %p We believe that teaching consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum we created. We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end of the week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert teachers on hand all day, and pairing with other students are all key to our teaching process.

    %h2 Why us?
    %p
      %span Learning is so much more than a curriculum and some educational materials.

    %p We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end-of-week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert teachers on hand all day, and pairing with other students are all key to our learning process.

    %p Programming is a practical skill - reading books or listening to lectures alone will never make you a developer. We encourage our students to spend every waking second thinking about and writing code... And many of them end up dreaming about it too! This is the only way to become a job-ready junior developer in a few short months. We start every day with a lecture or a workshop, and outside of 'class work', most of our students' time is spent pair programming on practical exercises in the presence of experts.

    %p We don't want our students getting bored, so we encourage people to explore topics that interest them, and since no 2 students are alike, we use the interactive learning environment to tailor the experience for each cohort. In short - if you've never heard of the technologies we list above, don't be put off, and if you already have some experience of coding, there's still a huge amount of value to be had enrolling on one of our courses. We also regularly invite industry expects to give talks to our students. It's a great opportunity to learn from practicing professionals and build your network. So far we have hosted speakers from Stripe, Forward Parners, Moo, Happy Bear Software,Shutl, Skimlinks and many others.

    %p We often get soft software development companies coming in to pair with our students too. We've been fortunate enough in the past to have developers from Pivotal Labs, Skimlinks and other companies to come pair with our students.

    %h2 Course Structure
    %p Below is the breakdown of our course structure. To keep pace with the fast-moving nature of the tech industry, we update our curriculum frequently, so please be aware that this structure is dynamic and prone to regular changes.

    %h3 The Pre-Course

    %p In the four weeks preceding the course students take part in a mandatory part-time pre-course to ensure all students obtain the required basic level of competence. We focus on the foundations: command-line, version control and the basics of Ruby. The pre-course requires an average of 15-20 hours per week to complete successfully. Access to a computer with an internet connection is a necessity. Students will be allocated a mentor from their preceding cohort, to help direct their learning and assist with any technical problems. Each Friday during the pre-course, we will send out a challenge to help solidify and focus the students' learning and to check in on their progress.

    %h3 Week 1 — Test-Driven Development and Object-Oriented Programming

    %p The main topics of week 1 are test-driven development and object-oriented programming. By now the students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes. This week we starting creating our own classes in a test-driven way. The aim of this week is to understand how to structure the code well using objects. The Friday challenge involves writing a simple object-oriented system of interacting classes.

    %h3 Week 2 — Further TDD and OOP

    %p This week we'll be building a game using test-driven development and object-oriented programming to make sure all students understand these important concepts well. We'll also cover more advanced Ruby topics: lambdas vs procs, composition vs inheritance, iterators and recursion. The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods of the Ruby core library.

    %h3 Week 3 — Introduction to Web Development

    %p By now the students are comfortable using Ruby and writing object-oriented code in a test-driven way. In week 3 we focus on the fundamentals of the web: HTTP protocol, Sinatra framework, HTML & CSS. We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome. The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to Heroku.

    %h3 Week 4 — Databases and User Management

    %p It's time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper. In this week we talk about relational databases, key-value stores and SQL. We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts: using hashing and salting, choosing a good hashing algorithm and mitigating common security risks. The students write a user management system (sign up, sign in, sign out, etc) from scratch paying special attention to the security aspects. Finally, the students also learn how to use Capybara to test-drive web applications. The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases.

    %h3 Week 5 — Front-End Technologies

    %p Now that the students can build database-backed Sinatra applications in test-driven mode, while paying attention to security considerations, it's time to start talking about other front-end technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and responsive design. The Friday challenge asks the students to reimplement the front-end of one of the most popular websites in the world.

    %h3 Week 6 — Lab Week

    %p This is a less structured week to allow students to consolidate their learning. Students may choose to revisit topics from the previous weeks, catch up on missed work or explore new projects.

    %h3 Week 7 — NodeJS

    %p NodeJS is a powerful Javascript framework that allows developers to use the same programming language for both their front-end and back-end development. This week, students will create a simple-yet-powerful interactive web application. The Friday challenge is based on refreshing Ruby knowledge.

    %h3 Week 8 — Ruby on Rails Basics

    %p In week 8 we start working with Ruby on Rails. By now the students have a solid understanding of Ruby, the web (HTTP, HTML, Javascript, etc) and have experience using databases. Armed with all this knowledge, they find Rails easy to understand because it merely automates what they can do without it. This week we talk about ActiveRecord, asset pipeline, routing and Rails architecture. The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on Rails.

    %h3 Week 9 — Advanced Ruby on Rails Topics

    %p This week we talk about more advanced topics: websockets, HTML5 APIs, using Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation, connecting to various APIs: Stripe, Twilio, etc. The challenge for this week focuses on these topics.

    %h3 Week 10 — The Final Project

    %p By now the students are confident junior developers. To put their skills to test, they build a final project that shows how far they've come since they started. This week we introduce few new topics but instead focus on helping the students to build the first version of their final project.

    %h3 Week 11 — Graduation

    %p Early in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible. This is going to be the most intensive week at Makers Academy, when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code. There is no Friday challenge. Instead, we have a graduation ceremony, followed by a party attended by friends, families, hiring partners, recruiters, ex-students and prospective students of Makers Academy.

    %h3 Week 12 — Hiring Week

    %p This week our new graduates will receive the personal attention of our expert placements team. They will focus on honing life-long learning skills and preparing to enter the jobs market. This could include technical tests, working on open-source code or even working on projects for charities that we partner with.
