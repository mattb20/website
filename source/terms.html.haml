      %h1 Terms and Conditions
%section.article--centered
  %article
    %p The following terms and conditions apply to all students accepted to study at Makers Academy (run by Makers Academy Limited (company number 08253870) of 50-52 Commercial St, London, E1 6LT). By applying for a Makers Academy course or paying a deposit against Makers Academy course fees you confirm acceptance of these terms and conditions as legally binding on you until successful completion by you of the course (unless terminated or cancelled earlier in accordance with these terms and conditions).

    %h3 Course Attendance and Conduct
    %p Makers Academy courses are intensive courses that require a serious commitment from all students. Makers Academy wants to ensure that all students on its courses have the best possible opportunity to succeed and therefore reserves the right to suspend from the course any student who in any way disrupts the course environment. We hope that our selection process means we will never have to do this, of course. Other than in the event of serious disruptive behavior we will seek to resolve any issues by way of coaching and dialogue before taking more serious steps.

    %p If, despite our careful selection process, we find (acting reasonably and having undertaken a thorough investigation) that a student is failing to keep up with the demands of the course they have chosen, and after consulting with the student we decide that the student is not likely to successfully complete the course, we reserve the right to require the student to leave the course. Provided we are satisfied, acting reasonably and taking all reasonable circumstances into consideration, that the student has made a good faith effort to succeed on the course we may choose to refund a pro-rata amount of the course fees paid by a student who is required to leave (based on the number of full weeks of the course remaining after the student was required to leave, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks) .In any other circumstances the terms of section 4 (“Payment of Fees if the course is not completed”) below will apply.

    %p Students will be required to comply with all rules and regulations of Makers Academy or the premises in which Makers Academy courses are held. Makers Academy reserves the right to exclude any student for failure to do so.

    %h3 Course Content and Structure
    %p Each Makers Academy course will last for 12 calendar weeks (Monday-Friday, including bank holidays), and Makers Academy may stipulate that up to one calendar day during that period is reserved for student self-study rather than tuition. In addition, Makers Academy courses will evolve. The content, structure and methods used in each course is subject to a constant process of review and improvement. This means that the course that you attend may not be identical to previous courses, and, whilst it will be materially the same, may not be identical to that described on the Makers Academy website.

    %h3 Deposit

    %p Anyone accepted on a Makers Academy course is required to pay a non-refundable £800 deposit to secure their place on the course, which will be deducted from the total course fees owed. Makers Academy operates a “first come first served” policy so once you have paid your deposit we will reserve a place for you on our next available course (subject to your payment of the course fees as described below).

    %h3 Course Fees

    %p Following payment of the deposit, the student must pay 100% of the published fee for the relevant course (less the deposit) so that it is received in Makers Academy’s bank account not later than 10 days after the commencement of the PreCourse. The fees are non-refundable if the student withdraws from the course within 7 working days of the start of the full time Course.

    %p If payment in full is not received by Makers Academy in its bank account not later than 10 days after the commencement of the PreCourse, Makers Academy may, at its option, re-allocate the place reserved for the student to a wait-listed student in which case the original student will no longer be able to attend the course and will not be entitled to be repaid their deposit.

    %h3 Payment method and external payment plan options

    %p Makers Academy will direct students to the payment services provider used by Makers Academy so that the student can pay the deposit and course fees online. Alternatively, students can pay the deposit and course fees by bank transfer to Makers Academy’s nominated bank account.

    %p Third party providers may, from time to time, offer loans to prospective Makers Academy students. These providers are entirely independent of Makers Academy and Makers Academy assumes no responsibility or liability for the loans or services that they offer. In particular, students must undertake their own due diligence on each provider and the terms of any loans or services that they offer.

    %h3 Payment of Fees if the course is not completed

    %p If a student fails to complete a course, Makers Academy reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge the student the full amount of fees outstanding (being the full course fee less the deposit paid) immediately following confirmation that the student will not be completing the course for any reason.  In exceptional circumstances Makers Academy may, in its sole discretion, agree to waive payment of part or all of the outstanding fees.

    %h3 Refund Policy

    %p Any deposit or course fee paid by a student in accordance with the payment plan selected by the student set out in section 3 above is non-refundable unless the course on which the student is enrolled is cancelled (whether prior to the course commencing, or after its commencement) by Makers Academy, in which case any course fee which has been paid by the student will be refunded in full.  If a course is temporarily suspended for a period of less than one month no course fees will be refunded. If a course is suspended for a period of longer than one month students enrolled on that course will be given the option of continuing the course when it resumes or receiving a pro-rata refund of course fees for the suspended part of the course (based on the number of full weeks of the course that were suspended, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks).

    %h3 PreCourse

    %p Makers Academy may, at its discretion, require students to complete a PreCourse prior to the start of the full course for which course fees are payable. This PreCourse will be provided at no additional cost to students and is intended to ensure that each student is suitable to participate in the full course. It is envisaged that each PreCourse will last for 15 hours per week for four weeks prior to the commencement of the relevant full course. If a student fails to complete the PreCourse, or Makers Academy reasonably determines that the student is not suitable to participate in the full course (including if he/she does not pass any final technical test set by Makers Academy), the student shall not be permitted to participate in the full course (and shall not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid deposit but shall be entitled to a full refund of any other course fees already paid).

    %h3 Right to Study

    %p
      All students must have the right to study in the UK under applicable UK rules, and hold a current visa if necessary. A guide to these rules can be found at:

    %p As a general rule you will not need a visa if you hold a passport issued by the UK or any other country in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.

    %p Please note that Makers Academy is not currently an accredited institution for the purposes of the “student visitor” category.

    %p Students will be required to produce an EEA or Swiss passport on enrolment on a course.  If you intend to rely on other documents you should provide full details to Makers Academy when applying for a course.


    %h3 Liability

    %p If for any reason Makers Academy cancels a planned course after a student has been accepted on the course Makers Academy will refund to the student any deposit and course fees paid by the student (as per section 5) but will have no further liability to the student.

    %p Except in respect of death or personal injury caused by Makers Academy's negligence or Makers Academy’s fraud, Makers Academy shall not be liable (to the extent able to be excluded at law) to any student by reason of any representation (unless fraudulent), or any implied warranty, condition or other term, or any duty at common law, or under the express terms of the contract for any loss of profit or any indirect, special or consequential loss, damage, costs, expenses or other claims (whether caused by the negligence of Makers Academy, its servants or agents or otherwise) which arise out of or in connection with the provision of the Makers Academy course and the entire liability of Makers Academy under or in connection with the course shall not exceed the amount of Makers Academy's charges for the course on which the student is or has applied to be enrolled.

    %p Makers Academy shall not be liable to the student or be deemed in breach of contract by reason of any delay or failure to perform any of Makers Academy's obligations in relation to the course if this was due to any cause beyond Makers Academy's reasonable control.
