          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>Makers Academy is a fully immersive, full-time computer programming course in London, designed to turn people with no knowledge of web development into job-ready junior developers in just 12 weeks. We’re Europe’s #1 Developer Bootcamp, running new classes of 24 - 28 students every 4 weeks in the heart of London's Tech City & every 12 weeks from the comfort of your own home.</p>

        <h3>Life as part of the Makers Academy Community</h3>
        <p>Being a student at Makers Academy is a very emotional journey. Eating, sleeping and breathing code becomes a huge part of your life, but looking after your wellbeing is also critical to becoming a great developer. On site we have Dana, our Chief Joy Officer - a certified yoga instructor who runs daily yoga and meditation classes and is here to look after your well being but don't worry if you're a remote student, Dana can also provide remote check ins too and send resources on how to develop your own meditation practise.</p>
        <p>It’s also important to unwind and bond socially with your cohort. We're surrounded by some of London's quirkiest cafes, yummiest street food and busiest pubs. We host regular events such as Petcha Kutcha lightning talks, games nights, karaoke nights, as well as organising group activities like climbing, go-karting and going to the theatre. Remote students are encouraged to start engaging wih their local tech community and if another Remote student is near you, we encourage you to meet up and bond!</p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          <span>Makers Academy was founded by Evgeny Shadchnev and Rob Johnson when they met at Forward labs.</span>
          Evgeny was a classically trained software developer and as he was trying to build out his team he discovered a lack of qualified developers on the market. At the same time, Rob had been teaching himself to program through a book on Objective C and it took him 9 months and 30 hours a week to get through it. A conversation between the two made them realise that while computer science programs were good at drilling students with theory, they were training people to become computer science professors instead of programmers, and something had to be done.
        </p>
        <p>About 4 months after that conversation they started their first cohort ‐ in February 2013 - creating Makers Academy - an alternative to university and a vocational route into a job as a web developer, allowing people to switch careers and learn to code in 3 hyper-intensive months in London. Before we knew it, forcing people to move to London in order to learn to code felt far too limiting, so in February 2015 we launched Makers Academy Remote, codenamed 'Ronin': a course that leverages everything we've learned at Makers Academy to help people all over the world learn to code - from the comfort of their own home.</p>
        <p>Makers Academy has now been going for over 3 years and has graduated over 600 students.</p>

                <dd><p>Absolutely. Programming expertise takes years to master, but that's not the point of Makers Academy. We want to give you a foundation so that you can be a top candidate for an entry-level position at a world class startup or technology company. Whether you're looking to change careers or you want to start your own startup but can't find a technical co-founder, Makers Academy is for you.

It's designed to find people who have natural reasoning skills, bags of drive and clear passion for learning to code. We're not testing whether you've memorised syntax - we're testing whether you can follow instructions and have the passion to learn some basic code without our support. The following articles will help you develop the sorts of behaviours and skills we look for in a candidate:</p>

It's learning where to go to find answers. It's learning about what the atmosphere of working in a startup is really like. It's learning to be a Maker from some of the best Makers in the world.</p></dd>

In reality, anything above If/Else statements and simple AND/OR logic is done largely by the computer. It’s more important that you have the right sort of mentality, that you’re comfortable working in ‘the unknown’ and that you aren’t afraid to fail. So long as you have a rudimentary understanding of basic maths, you’ve got everything you need.</p></dd>

One of the main problems people have in teaching themselves to code is the inconsistency in learning. The 12-week program provides full immersion to overcome this barrier and we're not yet certain how we could deliver that with a part-time regiment…but we're working on it. Stay tuned!</p></dd>

Well - a year in software development is a lifetime in other industries. We update our course materials every 4 weeks to fit the needs of the market and the needs of our hiring partners, so we do not and will never offer official accreditation. We don't care for fancy pieces of paper - we want you to leave the course with the ability to build real projects. That's our 'qualification'.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Yes. We have developed a part time PreCourse that needs to be completed before starting the course. We focus on the foundations: command-line, version control and the basics of Ruby. The PreCourse requires a minimum of 20 hours per week to complete successfully.</p></dd>
