          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>Makers Academy is a fully immersive, full-time computer programming course in London, designed to turn people with no knowledge of web development into job-ready junior developers in just 12 weeks. We’re Europe’s #1 Developer Bootcamp, running new classes of 25 students every 6 weeks, and we’re based in the heart of London’s Tech City.</p>

        <h3>Life at Makers</h3>
        <p>Being a student at Makers Academy is a very emotional journey. Eating, sleeping and breathing code becomes a huge part of your life, but looking after your wellbeing is also critical to becoming a great developer. On site we have Dana, our Chief Joy Officer - a certified yoga instructor who runs daily yoga and meditation classes and is here to look after your well being.</p>
        <p>It’s also important to unwind and bond socially with your cohort. We're surrounded by some of London's quirkiest cafes, yummiest street food and busiest pubs. We also host regular events such as Petcha Kutcha lightning talks, games nights, karaoke nights, as well as organising group activities like climbing, go-karting and going to the theatre.</p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          <span>Makers Academy was founded by Evgeny Shadchnev and Rob Johnson when they met at Forward labs.</span>
          Evgeny was a classically trained software developer and as he was trying to build out his team he discovered a lack of qualified developers on the market. At the same time, Rob had been teaching himself to program through a book on Objective C and it took him 9 months and 30 hours a week to get through it. A conversation between the two made them realise that while computer science programs were good at drilling students with theory, they were training people to become computer science professors instead of programmers, and something had to be done.
        </p>
        <p>About 4 months after that conversation they started their first cohort &hyphen; in February 2013 - creating Makers Academy - an alternative to university and a vocational route into a job as a web developer, allowing people to switch careers and learn to code in 3 hyper-intensive months. Makers Academy has now been going for over 2 years and has graduated over 300 students.</p>

              <dl class='definition' id='why-is-it-called-makers-academy'>
                <dt>Why is it called Makers Academy?</dt>
                <dd><p>Paul Graham, the tech startup visionary behind <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">YCombinator</a> coined the term Maker for those individuals that truly produce. The Makers Academy mission is to give every student the skills to call themselves a Maker.</p></dd>

                <dt>Where does Makers Academy take place?</dt>
                <dd><p>Makers Academy officially runs 9am to 6pm, Monday to Friday at the Makers Academy studio in Shoreditch at 50-52 Commercial St – right at the centre of the tech startup community, a few minutes away from Shoreditch High Street station and Google Campus. We welcome anyone who wants to come visit and see how we operate.</p></dd>

                <dt>Can I really learn to program in 12 weeks?</dt>
                <dd><p>Absolutely. Programming expertise takes years to master, but that's not the point of Makers Academy. We want to give you a foundation so that you can be a top candidate for an entry-level position at a world class startup or technology company. Whether you're looking to change careers or you want to start your own startup but can't find a technical co-founder, Makers Academy is for you.

                <dd><p>At the moment we do not have a dedicated housing department but members of our team can assist you with finding short term accommodation in London. In the past students have used sites like Gumtree, Zoopla, Spareroom.co.uk and many others to find a house. In London it's pretty easy to find a room at short notice if you put your mind to it.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>While we don't set specific limits on how many students we accept, typically about 10% of applicants end up studying at Makers Academy. We have a rigorous selection process, designed to find the most capable, driven and passionate people, and we aren't afraid to turn people away if we don't think they have what it takes to succeed at Makers Academy. It's not called "Oxbridge meets the Marines, but for Developers" for nothing!</p></dd>

                <dd><p>After submitting your online application, we'll invite you for an interview. In the interview we'll ask a few questions and do a bit of simple pair programming. You have no need to be afraid - we're not testing to see if you can already code. We're testing to see how you handle stressful situations where you're navigating the unknown. It'll be fun - we promise!</p></dd>

                <dd>
                  <p>In truth, there isn't a huge amount you can do to improve your chances at the interview stage. It's designed to find people who have natural intelligence, bags of drive and clear passion for learning to code. We're not testing what you do or don't know, we're looking mainly at whether you have the right mindset to benefit from a course like ours. A developer typically spends most of their working lives in 'the unknown', and we're trying to assess whether this is something you can handle, something you might even enjoy, and ultimately if it's something in which you can excel.</p>
                  
                  <p>Having said that, if you do already have some coding experience, even if you only went through a few introductory tutorials, this will be to your advantage. We recommend the following resources to get started as a web developer, regardless of whether you want to join Makers Academy or not:</p>

The cost is the same wherever you're from and you apply in the normal way. Three important things to bear in mind: Firstly, you aren't able to get a student visa for Makers Academy as we haven't yet received the required accreditation. Secondly, we have partnered with Migreat.com to provide you with assistance on getting the right visa easily sorted. Migreat.com is like Skyscanner for immigration. In a few clicks, their visa tool will give you an idea of the visa you are eligible for and a to-do list of documents for you to come on board. Migreat has online contacts for a great number of immigration lawyers, for all types of budget and visa. If you are confused by the application documents, you can ask their immigration experts for a little help. The platform is all free to use and you can ask them to refer you to an expert to do your visa application directly on the platform - though this will come with a fee. Thirdly, you'll only be allowed to take the up-front payment plan.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>It’s a bit of a cliche that coding is all about Maths (Computer Science is Maths heavy… Writing code, not so much!). In reality, anything above If/Else statements and simple AND/OR logic is done largely by the computer. It’s more important that you have the right sort of mentality, that you’re comfortable working in ‘the unknown’ and that you aren’t afraid to fail. So long as you have a rudimentary understanding of basic maths, you’ve got everything you need.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Currently we only offer our full-time course because we don't believe we could deliver a world-class result on a part-time basis - yet. One of the main problems people have in teaching themselves to code is the inconsistency in learning. The 12-week program provides full immersion to overcome this barrier and we're not yet certain how we could deliver that with a part-time regiment…but we're working on it. Stay tuned!</p></dd>

                <dd><p>By far the best way to learn to code in such a short amount of time is to live and breathe it. You would need to attend Makers Academy from 9am-6pm, Monday-Friday, for the 12 weeks that you're studying. Bear in mind that this is a minimum requirement - the more time you give to the course the better the results will be! If you absolutely cannot make it to London, we have a new full-time online program that mirrors our off-line course. <a href="http://ronin.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank">Find out more about our Ronin cohort</a>.</p></dd>
