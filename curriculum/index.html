          <h1>Curriculum</h1>
          <p>We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum we've created. We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end-of-week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational process.</p>

                  <p>In the four weeks preceding the full-time course, all students are required to complete a (very important!) part-time PreCourse, which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enrol at Makers Academy. In the first week, we focus on the foundations: first, the command-line, which is key to navigating around your computer; second, you'll tackle version control using Git and Github. This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges. The PreCourse requires a minimum of 20 hours per week to complete successfully, but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse, the better. Each Friday during the PreCourse, we send out a challenge to help solidify and focus students' learning and check in on their progress.</p>

                  <p>The main topics of week 1 are test-driven development and object-oriented programming. By now, students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes. This week we start creating our own classes in a test-driven way. The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects. The Friday challenge involves writing a simple object-oriented system of interacting classes.</p>

We also cover more advanced Ruby and programming topics: lambdas vs procs, composition vs inheritance, iterators and recursion. The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods from the Ruby core library.</p>

In week 3 we focus on the fundamentals of the web: HTTP protocols, the Sinatra framework, HTML & CSS. We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome. The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to Heroku.</p>

                  <p>It's time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper. In this week we talk about relational databases, key-value stores and SQL. We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts: hashing and salting, choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks. Students write a user management system (sign up, sign in, sign out, etc) from scratch, paying special attention to the security aspects. Finally, students also learn how to use Capybara to test-drive web applications. The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases. This is a an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web development.</p>

                  <p>Now that students can build test-driven, secure, database-backed web applications, it's time to start talking about other front-end technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and responsive design. Students begin learning their second language: JavaScript, also known as the language of the web. The Friday challenge asks students to reimplement the front-end of one of the most popular websites in the world.</p>

                  <p>This week is all about teamwork as students are introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace. Working on a set project in small groups, students will learn Git workflow, QA, Standups/Scrums, Kanban and Pair Programming in a team environment. This is also a great opportunity to practice and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeks.</p>

                  <p>In week 7 we start working with Ruby on Rails. By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby, the web (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc) and have experience using databases. Armed with all this knowledge, they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it. This week we talk about ActiveRecord, the asset pipeline, routing and Rails architecture. The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on Rails.</p>

                  <p>By now students are confident junior developers. To put their skills to their test, they build a final project that shows how far they've come since they started. This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final project.</p>

This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy, when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code. There is no Friday challenge. Instead, we have a graduation ceremony, followed by a party attended by friends, families, hiring partners, recruiters, ex-students and prospective students of Makers Academy.</p>

This could include technical tests, working on open-source code or even working on projects for charities that we partner with. For those students who attend Makers as entrepreneurs, this is a great week to start working on your MVP!</p>
