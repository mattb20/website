          <h1>Curriculum</h1>
          <p>We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum we have created. We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end-of-week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational process.</p>

        <h3>Why us?</h3>
        <p>
          <span>Learning is so much more than a curriculum and some educational materials.</span>
          We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end-of-week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert coaches on hand all day, and pairing with other students are all key to our educational process.
        </p>
        <p>Programming is a practical skill - reading books or listening to lectures alone will never make you a developer. We encourage our students to spend every waking second thinking about and writing code... And many of them end up dreaming about it too! This is the only way to become a job-ready junior developer in a few short months. We start every day with a lecture or a workshop, and outside of 'classwork', most of our students' time is spent pair programming on practical exercises in the presence of experts.</p>
        <p>We don't want our students getting bored, so we encourage people to explore topics that interest them, and since no two students are alike, we use the interactive learning environment to tailor the experience for each cohort. In short - if you've never heard of the technologies we talk about, don't be put off, and if you already have some experience of coding, there's still a huge amount of value to be had enrolling on one of our courses. We also regularly invite industry experts to give talks to our students. It's a great opportunity to learn from practicing professionals and build your network. So far we have hosted speakers from Tesla, Intel, Stripe, Forward Parners, Moo, Shutl, Skimlinks and many many others.</p>
        <p>We often get software development companies coming in to pair with our students too. We've been fortunate enough to have developers from Pivotal Labs, Skimlinks and other amazing companies coming to our offices and pairing with our students.</p>

                <h4 class='subheader'>Everything you need to get ready for the main course</h4>
                <p>In the four weeks preceding the full-time course, all students take a (very important!) part-time pre-course, which ensures that all of our students get to the required basic level of competence when they enroll at Makers Academy. We focus on the foundations: first, the command-line, which is key to navigating around your computer, creating files and directories and give you the ability to search your entire system; second, you'll tackle version control using Git, which is great for saving your work and makes it super easy to collaborate with other coders, and finally you'll learn some basic Ruby, which will be your first programming language. The pre-course requires a minimum of 15 hours per week to complete successfully, but the more time you can spend on the pre-course, the better. Access to a computer with an internet connection is a necessity. Students will be allocated a mentor from their preceding cohort, to help direct their learning and assist with any technical problems. Each Friday during the pre-course, we send out a challenge to help solidify and focus students' learning and check in on their progress.</p>

                <h2>Week 1</h2>
                <h4 class='subheader'>Test-Driven Development and Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
                <p>The main topics of week 1 are test-driven development and object-oriented programming. By now, students have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes. This week we start creating our own classes in a test-driven way. The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects. The Friday challenge involves writing a simple object-oriented system of interacting classes.</p>

                <p>This week we build a game using test-driven development and object-oriented programming to make sure students understand these important concepts well. We also cover more advanced Ruby and programming topics: lambdas vs procs, composition vs inheritance, iterators and recursion. The Friday challenge involves reimplementing some of the more advanced methods from the Ruby core library.</p>

                <h4 class='subheader'>Introduction to Web Development</h4>
                <p>By now, students are comfortable using Ruby and writing object-oriented code in a test-driven way. In week 3 we focus on the fundamentals of the web: HTTP protocols, the Sinatra framework, HTML & CSS. We also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Chrome. The Friday challenge involves building a Sinatra application and deploying it to Heroku.</p>

                <h4 class='subheader'>Databases and User Management</h4>
                <p>It's time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper. In this week we talk about relational databases, key-value stores and SQL. We also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts: hashing and salting, choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks. Students write a user management system (sign up, sign in, sign out, etc) from scratch, paying special attention to the security aspects. Finally, students also learn how to use Capybara to test-drive web applications. The Friday challenge focuses on relational databases. This is a an important milestone as students now have a full picture of web development.</p>

                <p>Now that students can build test-driven, secure, database-backed web applications, it's time to start talking about other front-end technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and responsive design. Students begin learning their second language: JavaScript, also known as the language of the web. The Friday challenge asks students to reimplement the front-end of one of the most popular websites in the world.</p>

                <p>Students expand their knowledge of JavaScript by learning Angular (a popular front-end framework) and Node (JavaScript for the server), combining them to build powerful full-stack applications. The Friday challenge is based on refreshing your Ruby knowledge.</p>

                <p>In week 8 we start working with Ruby on Rails. By now students have a solid understanding of Ruby, the web (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc) and have experience using databases. Armed with all this knowledge, they find Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what they can do without it. This week we talk about ActiveRecord, the asset pipeline, routing and Rails architecture. The Friday challenge focuses on the basics of Ruby on Rails.</p>

                <h2>Week 9</h2>
                <h4 class='subheader'>Advanced Ruby on Rails Topics</h4>
                <p>This week we talk about more advanced topics: Websockets, HTML5 APIs, using Bootstrap or Foundation, connecting to various APIs: Stripe, Twilio, etc. The challenge for this week focuses on these topics.</p>

                <h4 class='subheader'>The Final Project</h4>
                <p>By now students are confident junior developers. To put their skills to their test, they build a final project that shows how far they've come since they started. This week we introduce fewer new topics and instead focus on helping students to build the first version of their final project.</p>

                <h4 class='subheader'>Graduation</h4>
                <p>Early in the week we declare a feature freeze to make sure the final projects are as polished as possible. This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy, when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive code. There is no Friday challenge. Instead, we have a graduation ceremony, followed by a party attended by friends, families, hiring partners, recruiters, ex-students and prospective students of Makers Academy.</p>

                <h4 class='subheader'>Hiring Week</h4>
                <p>This week our new graduates receive the personal attention of our expert placements team. They focus on honing life-long learning skills and preparing to enter the jobs market. This could include technical tests, working on open-source code or even working on projects for charities that we partner with. For those students who attend Makers as entrepreneurs, this is a great week to start working on your MVP!</p>
