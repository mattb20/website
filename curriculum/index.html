          <h1>Curriculum</h1>
          <p>We believe that learning to code consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum we've created. We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end-of-week challenges to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert coaches on hand all day and pairing with other students are all key to our educational process.</p>

                  <p>In the four weeks preceding the full-time course, you are required to complete a mandatory, part-time PreCourse from home. This will ensure that you get to the required level of coding knowledge before starting full time. In the first week, you focus on the foundations: first, the command-line, which is key to navigating around your computer; second, you'll tackle version control using Git and Github. This is followed by learning Ruby syntax through challenges over 3 weeks, culminating in building your Github CV for the start of your coding journey. The PreCourse requires at least 20 hours per week to complete successfully, but the more time you can spend on the PreCourse, the better.</p>

                  <p>The main topics of week 1 are test driven development and object oriented programming. By now, you'll have some experience writing pure Ruby code and are familiar with the functionality of core Ruby classes. This week you start creating your own classes in a test driven way. The aim of this week is to understand how to structure code using objects. You'll also meet the careers team who will be helping you get jobs at the end of the course. Weekend challenges are completed each week to reflect and consolidate the learning from the previous week.</p>

In week 3 you'll focus on the fundamentals of the web: HTTP protocols, the Sinatra framework, HTML & CSS. You also learn how to deploy our code to Heroku and use the development tools in Google Chrome. Finally, you'll also learn how to use Capybara to test drive web applications. This week is usually a popular one, as you're finally able to deploy a working application to the web.</p>

                  <p>It's time to learn how to add a relational database to a Sinatra application using DataMapper. In this week you look at relational databases, key-value stores and SQL. You'll also spend a lot of time discussing proper management of user accounts along with hashing and salting, choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and mitigating common security risks. You'll write a user management system (sign up, sign in, sign out, etc) from scratch, paying special attention to the security aspects. This is an important milestone as you'll now have a full picture of web development.</p>

                  <p>Now that you can build test-driven, secure, database-backed web applications, it's time to start talking about front-end technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and responsive design. Now you start to explore a new language: JavaScript, also known as the language of the web.</p>

                  <p>This week is all about teamwork as you're introduced to some techniques and practices common in an Agile or XP workplace. Working on a set project in small groups, you'll learn to master Git workflow, QA, Standups/Scrums, Kanban and pair programming in a team environment. This is also a great opportunity to practise and consolidate the skills and concepts learned in previous weeks. This week you'll also start working with the careers team so you can start planning your job hunting strategy.</p>

                  <p>You'll come back to JavaScript this week by building a JavaScript testing framework - no fancy frameworks allowed! Students will demystify the inner workings of JavaScript frameworks as they build everything from the testing platform to the front end architecture of their application in pure JavaScript. Your careers session this week will be around how to sell your experience to potential employers.</p>

                  <p>In week 8 you'll start working with Ruby on Rails. By now you have a solid understanding of Ruby, the web (HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, etc) and experience using databases. Armed with all this knowledge, you'll find Ruby on Rails easy to understand as it merely automates what you can do without it. This week ActiveRecord is part of your learning, the asset pipeline, routing and Rails architecture. Our Careers team will run you through challenging your preconceptions about what kind of company you want to work for.</p>

This week will reinforce behaviours like testing first, using enough design upfront and using the XP values to guide your behaviour as a developer. The challenges this week will be undertaken individually, and are designed to mimic technical tests commonly used by employers as part of the recruitment process. You'll also start practicing technical interviews and networking.</p>

This is the most intensive week at Makers Academy, when all teams stay late trying to outperform each other to write the most impressive, test driven and clean code. Friday our careers team will put on a job hunting fair in the morning where our hiring partners will be showcasing their job vacancies followed by you giving your final project demo's. The evening will be a party attended by friends, families, hiring partners, recruiters, ex-students and prospective students of Makers Academy.</p>
