                <dt>What are you looking for in the video?</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>We are looking for people who can really convey their passion for coding and why they want to make this change in their life. We want to see who you are!</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>How do I upload the video?</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>The video does not need to be slick and can be simply recorded on your phone or webcam. We need you to upload your film to a video hosting site and send us the link to it. A simple way to do this is via YouTube.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Why is this only for people looking for a Junior Developer job in either London or Manchester?</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>As you won't be paying for this course upfront and only paying a small amount every month once you get a job, it's important to us and you that we get you your first job as a junior developer. Currently our networks are only in London and Manchester.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Can I do this course part time?</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>Unfortunately not. One of the keys to our course is being immersed into full time coding. We don't offer a part time course at the moment.</p>
