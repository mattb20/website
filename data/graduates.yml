  summary: Marketing Manager to Junior Developer at Deloitte Digital
  testimonial: The three words to describe Makers Academy are crazy, intense and awesome.
  cohort_month: December
  cohort_year: 2014
  blog_link: http://niccipell.wordpress.com
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was managing the marketing functions for a legal recruitment company.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I always wanted to learn to code and I kept doing the marketing thing but realised I still wanted to learn to code. I was speaking to a friend who connected me to Nikesh who was doing the course at the time and that convinced me.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I knew Nikesh who was doing the course at the time so I applied to both GA and Makers Academy but the actual interview process for Makers convinced me that Makers was the better choice. It gave me an insight into the course and I liked the atmosphere and vibe. I read a lot of blogs from students and that all convinced me.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The intensity of the course is difficult and relentless. There are so many moments where you think you are stupid but you have no choice but to keep going at it until you get it.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I was an alumni helper for a few months. I worked on a couple of paid freelance projects while job hunting and kept learning. I now have a job at Deloitte Digital.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: My life has changed completely because in real terms my career has completely changed and I’ve got a great group of friends that came out of Makers. Doing the course hits your confidence but weirdly makes you much more confident.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Make sure you do your research and make sure you budget so that you can take time to pick your dream job, but at the same time don’t overthink the choice.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive, but I don’t regret a single pound I spent as it has made so many things possible for me. I know if I tried to do it on my own I would not have gotten there quickly and would not be in the position that I am in now. A big thing that is underestimated is the large network that comes out of Makers Academy.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I left an 8 year career so I kept wondering if I was making a big mistake to start all over again. I’m so happy with my decision. It was risky but worth it.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Probably the best experience of my life! Crazy. Intense. Awesome.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Get yourself out there as soon as possible so you start to practice your interview skills and gain confidence in a new world for you.

  summary: Full-time Mum to Junior Developer at Mergermarket
  testimonial: Makers Academy is an investment in yourself and to be honest, it’s quite cheap in the long run. It’s about you as a person and you are gaining skills that will be extremely useful for many, many years and when you look at it that way, it's actually a steal.
  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a full time Mum for 7 years and before that I had my own franchise business.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've always loved tech and I was curious about code. A friend of mine said I should consider doing it as a career.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy through a bootcamp review website. I was deciding between Makers and GA. GA felt too international and a numbers game. Makers on the other hand felt non-salesy and genuine and I liked that.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I had a lot of guilt as my mind was on the course so much that I didn't get to spend much quality time with my children, and any spare time I had I spent it coding. I also had to keep pushing through the times where I felt so stupid.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I carried on working on my code. Merger Market was my 7th interview. It was difficult as I wanted to always do more and being a Mum I chose to spend more time with the kids, and that slowed my progress. I also needed to build my confidence. So it took a while. I had a lot of disappointing interviews, I'd give myself a few days and go back to coding and I kept attending Makers and got lots of support which is very special.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I feel much more confident. I'm more confident as a developer and I got a job! My family is just so proud of me.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: That everything you do is a risk. Life is full of risks and this is no different. This industry is not going anywhere and it is recession proof. Job wise you will be able to get a job at the end of the day, and if you love code there is no reason not too.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It's an investment in yourself and to be honest, it's quite cheap in the long run. It's not about the cash but it's also about you as a person and you are gaining a skill that will be useful for atleast another 40 or so years. It's a bargain.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was I wouldn't get a job and up until last week that is how I felt, but I got a job! I was also worried if I was too old to change careers, and yes it took a long time, but I got a job and no I was not too old. I kept at it and got lots of encouragement from the Makers Academy team.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Probably the best experience of my life!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be comfortable in people seeing your code. Test Drive your code and be yourself. One of my friends Dave from my cohort said "Just relax and remember how much you love coding."

  summary: Project Manager to Junior Developer at Atos Consulting
  testimonial: I am now enjoying work and getting to work with cool people. I’m just a lot happier than I was before.
  cohort_month: January
  cohort_year: 2015
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a project manager for a company that did home automation.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Lots of the tech we installed needed programming. Due to a shortage of people at the company capable of doing such programming, I started commissioning a little bit at the end of jobs and I enjoyed that more than what I was doing.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: My girlfriend came across Makers Academy. I had made the decision to get into software dev and I didn't know about bootcamps. I started to learn during evenings and took a part-time evening course for 6 weeks. After my first 2 hour evening session here at Makers, I realised that I had learned more at Makers than I did in that whole part-time course.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Initially, some concepts were difficult, but the hardest thing was managing my social life. I had met someone before the course who had previously done it, and I put my life on hold for 3 months, which was difficult.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: During graduation, lots of employers were wandering around. I talked with one who is now my boss. After graduation, I stayed in Makers Academy everyday for 6 weeks and became an alumni helper. I got the job offer at Atos Consulting 3-4 weeks later.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: In nearly every way, and all for the better. I am now enjoying work and getting to work with cool people. I'm just a lot happier than I was before.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. If you're thinking about it, it means you aren't happy where you are, so just do it. Especially if you are younger, then you shouldn't think twice.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is more than £8,000 with living costs, but there's a big difference between cost and value for me. It will be the best investment I will ever make. An investment in your education is one that continues to pay you back.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: Getting a job afterwards. From my experiences, since graduating from Makers I feel that there are more jobs out there than Makers Academy will ever be able to fill. There are more shitty devs out there than is possible, and Makers Academy students come out so skilled that it continues to amaze our employers. We know better practices than senior devs.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Best decision I ever made.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Don't compromise your values for the sake of money. If you come in looking for a specific job, don't take the first one you get just because you are worried you won't get a job. You will be a valuable dev in a short space of time and there will be more than one offer coming your way.

  cohort_month: May
  cohort_year: 2015
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working in retail.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've always been a techy, and I loved the code community and the idea that I could make awesome things from my computer.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I was looking online for resources on learning how to code and came across an article in the news about coding courses, Makers Academy looked awesome, friendly and super informative, so I thought there's no harm in applying if I don't get in, but thankfully I did!
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The work load and realisation of how much you're expected to learn, at first, was difficult to process. But you find out it's so much fun and you enjoy and look forward to every new task you get.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I was sceptical about getting a job and didn't want to leave Makers Academy at first, but hiring week was very useful and helped me boost my confidence. So I was super excited when I had my first interview only about a month after graduation and I got the job, which is even better!
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I was stuck after finishing college with no intentions to go uni, in a job I hated. Now I feel like I've learned so much, met so many awesome people, and got a job doing something I love along the way.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. Everyone has something they love doing, so why be stuck in something that bores you when you can switch up your life and do something you enjoy.

      answer: It's worth it, it's much cheaper than university and if you get a job after it eventually pays for itself.

      answer: Really fun, exciting and my first experience in education that I actually enjoyed!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?

  cohort_month: December
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working at Makers Academy as a Marketing Manager. So you could say I was a victim of my own marketing.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: Working in start-ups was one thing. I've always enjoyed creating tangible things and getting involved with creative pursuits. Combined with my interest in technology, it was only natural that I would start getting my hands dirty with some code.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The workload for sure. It isn't called intensive for no reason. I've never worked so hard at something in my life. But do not be put off, you will learn to deal with it and you will become better for it.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Afterwards, I got involved with some freelance work and then landed a job at Deloitte Digital.

      answer: For the better. I feel happier. I have a skill which is as close to magic as it gets.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: There are two options. You either stay in a career that doesn't fulfil you, or you take action until you reach your desired goal.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is an investment that will pay off in the long-term, provided you use the skills you learn afterwards. That could be as a career programmer or chasing an entrepreneurial dream.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I wouldn't end up liking it after all that commitment, but that was put to bed on day 1.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Brilliant.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?

  summary: Environmental Geography Grad to Junior Developer at Deloitte Digital
  testimonial: Makers Academy was the best investment I ever made!
  cohort_month: January
  cohort_year: 2015
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was at the University of York where I studied Environmental Geography.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I was playing around in codeacaedmy and in my degree I enjoyed the modules that involved computers.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy a year before I actually applied, but back then I thought it wasn't for me and I could not hack it. But when I came across it again I just decided to go for it, and figure it out as I got along.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Being comfortable with not knowing everything was hard but it led me to work harder.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: So after graduation I spent more than a month working on my code until Will and Ruben encouraged me to start applying for jobs. That is what I found the most scary, that I loved to code but I didn't know where I fit in. I then worked as an Alumni helper while applying to jobs and I did a couple of tech tests, but my first interview was with Deloitte Digital where I landed a job.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: My life now revolves around coding! I'm looking forward to starting my career.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: I was considering doing a masters in Computer Science but actually it's less time and money, and you learn more at Makers in short space of time. It's the best investment I ever made.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: It felt like a risk. I really enjoyed coding and I never coded full time so I had no idea if I could make a career out of it. I was also worried that not having industry experience would hold me back even more.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Amazing.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Prepare as much as possible and try and relax. In hindsight I would have started to apply to jobs earlier.

  cohort_year: 2015
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Before Makers Academy I was working in a Fashion Tech Startup doing a bit of everything, but my job title was business development. I went there straight from uni where I studied International Politics at Kings College.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had interest in it when I was studying politics and when I was working with the developers in the startup I got rather envious seeing what they can do.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: I lacked confidence in my coding capabilities.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I started to build on my personal projects and ideas and rebuilt my final project as we wanted to re-launch it. Then started to meet clients and started to pick up freelance work, which kept me coding everyday.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I work in a completely new industry. I didn't necessarily feel like a developer at graduation, but now I do even though it's only been a few months. I found the career path I want to pursue.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you want to you should. If you are not happy where you are then seek to do something that makes you happier. No fear.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It's a reasonable amount of money for the value of the skill you gain while you are here and it doesn't take long to pay off.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would be terrible at coding. I don't think I'm ever going to say I'm great at it, but I see myself as a developer.

      answer: Amazing. Intense. Quite life changing.

  summary: Online Marketing Manager to Junior Developer at Mergermarket
  testimonial: Makers Academy is challenging and intense, but full of rewards!
  cohort_month: May
  cohort_year: 2015
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as an Online Marketing Manager for multi-million dollar businesses.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've always been interested in tech ever since I was young, especially video games. I then started my career as an Online Marketing Manager which was a way to combine both my business studies and tech. I used to work with tech teams and really enjoyed it - sometimes I found myself trying to help them despite not having any knowledge. Over time, I became more and more interested in learning about the technical side of marketing.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I was researching about coding classes and then I came across Makers Academy. I didn’t want to do a computer science degree as I did not want to spend 3 years to learn the theory only. I already knew I wanted to do web development. I was really impressed with the relationship Makers has with employers so I decided to apply.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The amount of things we had to learn in a small amount of time was difficult. It feels like we have a lot to learn but no time to really digest.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation, I was working as an Alumni helper and now I'm a Developer at Mergermarket.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Take a leap of faith and give it a go. When you enroll, make sure to dedicate a lot of time to the pre-course as it is really beneficial.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive but it is an investment; what you get out of Makers Academy is not something you can get from online courses.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was that I would not be able to follow the course. During the pre-course while I was on holiday my computer died, so I didn't get a chance to go through the pre-course material properly. I still sometimes feel like I'm still going over things but I also feel that the job of a Software Developer is to always be slightly out of your depth and to always be learning new stuff.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Challenging and intense but full of rewards.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Do as many interviews as you can and get as much experience as you can. But know that what we've learnt in 3 months is amazing and people really recognise it. So go out there and try out.

      answer: I love getting up everyday because I love what I do now. It doesn't feel like work. I enjoy the challenges. A bad day is still a fun day.

      answer: If you have a gut feeling that this is what you want to do, don't ignore that feeling. Its hard and takes a bit of luck and people will question you, but if you want to combine logic and creativity then you should do it.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is. It's worth it, I am already earning more than I did prior. Makers is a solid investment and just have a look what you'll get out of it!

      answer: Doing tutorials I was finding online and enjoying that didn't necessarily mean I would like doing it everyday. And now I enjoy it.

      answer: Great fun! The best thing I've done in terms of education!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: You've got to prepare as much as possible, but relax and be confident in the interview and show yourself in the best possible light. There were things I didn't know in my interviews but I simply explained what I did know or just asked the interviewer.

      answer: I was worried that I couldn't get a job without a degree. Now I see people with degrees not getting the position I've applied for.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It was one of the best experiences of my life, pair programming with other people without any coding background made me feel more comfortable, and I learnt to break problems into smaller pieces in order to solve them better. The atmosphere was just magic, everyone is so positive and I was shocked after seeing how much I've actually done after 12 weeks (about 10 projects!). I have increased my communication skills by learning to pitch and work in teams. I love Makers and I always will!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Go for the company you like, if you show passion about what you do they don't care about anything else.

#  cohort: Graduated December 2014
#  blog_link: http://www.deniseyu.com
#  case_study:
#            - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
#              answer: Finishing my MSc in Social Policy at the LSE, trying to work in behavioural sciences and policy research.
#            - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
#              answer: I was always interested in building websites and was pretty good at HTML and CSS back in the day. I knew that coding is a valuable skill to have regardless of what industry I end up in.
#            - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
#              answer: I think I saw a Facebook or Google ad for Makers Academy at some point &emdash; I don't really remember. I decided to apply after reading some student blogs and testimonials on the website.
#            - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
#              answer: The hardest thing for me was being patient with myself. I had high expectations of myself going into the course, and many times when I didn't understand how to complete a task, I had to remember to separate the task at hand from some reflection of myself. It's very easy to fall into a nasty cycle of self-deprecation when you're surrounded by really intelligent, motivated people.
#            - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
#              answer: I currently work as a Junior Rails Developer at Third Space Learning. After graduation I spent 6 weeks on the floor as an alumni helper while frantically trying to get a job before my visa ran out and landed a job as a rails developer at an ed-tech startup. I've now moved onto to my 2nd job at Mergermarket.
#            - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
#              answer: I have an interesting job that forces me to think and learn something new everyday. I can't say that for the other jobs that I've had. I'm surrounded by supportive co-workers on and off the dev team, and it's a really great place to get my software development career started. I also have become very involved with coding-related meetups in London. I currently help organise Codebar each week, and recently became interested in learning Clojure. The London tech community is a tight-knit but welcoming one, and it's a very exciting time for me, personally and professionally.
#            - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
#              answer: Many people are put off by coding because they perceive it to be difficult. I was definitely one of these people. However, once you get past the first few weeks of memorising syntax and getting your head around the logic, you will realise that coding is the most incredibly rewarding skill you can learn. From a more pragmatic view, you only need to look at the front page of Techcrunch to see that Software Developers have incredibly high vertical and horizontal mobility -- so if you're the kind of person that doesn't like to sit still, the software development industry will give you freedom to travel and move around. If you get your feet wet with a good boot camp that teaches software craftsmanship and TDD and other best practices, you will have around the equivalent of a 6-month head start on other boot camp graduates applying for the same roles.
#            - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
#              answer: It's cheaper than an MSc in Computer Science, you will meet many people who are well-connected, and London development salaries are extremely good compared to continental Europe.
#            - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
#              answer: I thought I would be terrible at coding. I'm still not great, but I think I'm no longer terrible.
#            - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
#              answer: Admit readily to failure and shortcomings in your knowledge. Don't pretend like you know more than you do. This pisses off team leaders/product managers and instantly flags you as a bad team member. Get a sense of the company culture -- google the CEO, CTO, your immediate supervisor if you can. Have a story for how you discovered the company and why that particular company stands out to you. Assume that all of your social media profiles have been aggregated by recruitment tools and presented to the people interviewing you. Have at least one public repo on your Github that is well-tested, refactored, CLEAN, and that you understand 100%. Preferably not your final project, but better to have something that you built independently after Makers, using at least one new technology not taught on the course. Be sure that you can defend every single method and variable name you've chosen.

  summary: Illustrator to Junior Developer at New Bamboo
  testimonial: Students from Makers Academy are not the same kind of species as normal developers out there and it’s your background and experiences that don’t necessarily relate to coding that will give you an edge.
  cohort_month: June
  cohort_year: 2014
  blog_link: http://handmadecode.tumblr.com
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a Graphic designer and Illustrator.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: The desire to acquire new skills and learn new technologies made me want to start learning to code. I felt limited by my design skills and wanted to open up new doors for myself and expose myself to different opportunities. I also wanted to know how to make things for myself and explore a new creative medium. Coding ticked all the boxes!
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I googled around for courses - Makers was up there as the best. I read countless student reviews and was really impressed by the unique classroom teaching style. I was also won over by the placements team who seemed to be putting graduates into insanely good starting positions at some awesome companies.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: To begin with, I found pairing with other people quite hard and frustrating but then halfway through the course, you learn how to do it well and it's the best experience. I also found the fast pace quite difficult to keep up with. It didn't bother me so much though, and I trusted that given the extra hard work I put it, it would all eventually make sense.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I hit the ground running with back-to-back interviews and technical tests. The placements team are incredible and so supportive. I landed a job 4 weeks later.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: It's turned my life around. I didn't take this course with the intention of becoming a developer. At the time, I was interested in acquiring some front end skills so I could push forward my design work and take things from there. I ended up loving Ruby and getting a full stack role at a brilliant agency. I have a job that I love with clear focus, direction and endless possibilities.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. The direction of your life is never set in stone. Make sensible decisions, follow your heart and enjoy the ride.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: I thought the exact same thing. I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to apply for ages because of the huge price tag. But after the first day, you completely forget that this was ever an issue. Worth every penny.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was whether or not I would actually be able to learn anything of any value. Will I understand the content? Will I actually be able to sit down and make something from scratch? Would I become more employable? Will I get a job? Nothing is guaranteed on the course, but I can say that with enough enthusiasm, positivity and hard work there is no reason to worry.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Emotional, exhausting, exhilarating.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be yourself. Students from Makers Academy are not the same kind of species as normal developers out there and it's your background and experiences which don't necessarily relate to coding that will give you an edge. And TDD everything.

    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I finished on 20th June. I took the summer off to travel with my family and clean my github. I started looking for a job on 1st September. I did only one application through LinkedIn and I got the job. I was offered a paid three months internship. After two weeks working there they told me they were very happy with me, so after 6 weeks of internship I was made permanent. They offered me £28k. I'm very happy to work there.

    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: Living in London for three months without an income can be tough. £8,000 is definitely a lot of money but it's absolutley worth it. It's an investment for your future self.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: I've learned way more than software development. It was tough at the beginning but now I'm seeing the results.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?

  blog_link: https://sevenhoursbehind.wordpress.com/
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Before Makers Academy I did a Masters of Mechanical (Aeronautical) Engineering degree at Durham University.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: The experiences at university, a need for a challenge and wanting to see immediate result of my work led me to learn to code.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy at Silicon Milkroundabout, I had a chat with companies hiring there and they said that Makers Academy was a good start.

      answer: I applied to and was hired by Red Badger.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?

    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would end up working for a company that I didn't like on a project I didn't care about. I work for a consultancy that cares about everything they do. It's more a culture that is important than that who you are working for at Red Badger.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Make sure you have similar ideals to the company, that you fit their culture. Otherwise you will find it difficult to enjoy it there.

  cohort_month: June

    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a Research & Development Scientist at Linpac Packaging.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I had a little experience from my university degree and really enjoyed it so wanted to pursue it further.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy through a google search. I wanted to apply because it appeared to suit the sort of learning I was looking for. Intensive immersion of learning.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The lack of sleep!
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I have moved to London permanently. I achieved my goal of getting a developer role after the course and changing my career. I am now doing something that I enjoy every day and the work/life balance is a lot better.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: For me before I started the course it felt like a huge risk. I was quitting a well paid, secure job and paying a lot of money to do the course. There was no guarantee of employment at the end of it. However it still felt like a calculated risk, and one worth taking. If I didn't take that risk then I would still potentially be working in the same job with very little progress in changing careers. Makers Academy was the fast-track route to changing careers taking a bit more control of my life direction. It is still the best choice I have ever made.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is a lot of money, but you have to question how committed you are to making that change in your life. For me it was worth spending the money because I was committed to making that change.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was the question mark of how long it would take to secure a job after the course - and whether I would be able to secure a developer job or not. Luckily that question has now been answered.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Intense, tiring, fun. Everybody was very positive and driven to learning and working together. It was easy to stay motivated when in that environment.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Try to keep the motivation up after the course and find projects % tasks to code; to and try to pair with people even if it's remotely. I found it very hard to keep motivated sitting in an empty flat during the day. A complete contrast to Makers.

  summary: Business Development Manager to Junior Developer at Red56
  testimonial: Since graduation my life has changed, as I enjoy my work a lot more in general.
  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as a Business Development Manager for a B2B Media Company.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I wanted to have a new skill and I wanted to make things.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: Through an article in Vice that led me to an article in the Guardian. Friends of mine that were Graphic Designers though told me how much demand there was for people with coding experience as well.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Everything! In all seriousness, the hardest thing was the transition from an office mindset to a learning mindset. It took me a while to accept that finding the answers out for myself and moving at that pace was a lot more worth while than getting an answer from somewhere and moving on before I fully understood an issue.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I had intended to go back to my old job for 2 days a week post Makers, while I continued my learning and looking for a job. Makers were able to find me an internship, which has been an excellent way to learn about life as a developer and I got a job at Red56. I feel I have learned a lot more than I would have independently and now I have valuable work experience to add to my CV as well.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I enjoy my work a lot more in general. I have renewed enthusiasm for the two days a week spent at my old job and am loving interning as a developer.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. In my five months since I started at Makers, I have found the tech world inclusive, inspiring, rewarding and fun. It's a great industry to be a part of and it's also growing at a rate of knots. Exciting times!
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: Why would you not want to invest £8,000 in making your life better? You can learn to code in countless ways, however you are unlikely to get a fraction of the benefit you receive from your 12 weeks at Makers. You receive face to face tuition from experienced developers, you meet a group of peers who support you through the course and beyond, you find out about exciting new technologies from real trailblazers, you attend industry events and are able to network with potential employers, you receive talks from developers at all types of businesses (from household e-commerce brands to fledgling starts ups) that tell you of life in the developer world... and you get to do all of this in a first class facility that is open 65 hours a week. If that's not worth £8,000, I don't know what is.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I worried that I would not get "it", however makers taught me that "it" comes to you with hard work and enthusiasm. There is a lot that still baffles me about coding, however I know with patience and the correct approach I can solve any problem.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Awesome!
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be yourself, be honest and be enthusiastic. Your first job will likely be a bigger learning curve than Makers. Your potential employer needs to know you are someone who will be keen to learn, is aware of where they need to improve and will be easy to work with.

  summary: Project Manager to iOS Developer at MyGravity
  testimonial: MA was probably the best experience of my life! It was life-changing and like any big change, it wasn’t always easy but I now feel that my future is very bright.
  cohort_month: December
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working in project management in a small team at a social enterprise. It was interesting at first, but as time went on I didn't feel like I was developing any tangible skills.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've always enjoyed working with computers, but before Makers Academy my limit was really doing fancy graphs in Excel! In 2012 I started doing bits and pieces of Codecademy courses, but without any clear plan or end goal, life (and other hobbies) quickly overtook it. There just didn't seem to be any clear connection between following tutorials, and actually getting a job as a developer.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I read an article about Makers Academy when it first launched (around the time I was graduating from my history degree) and remember filing it away in my head as an awesome idea, but not in my life plan! At the time I needed a job pronto. However, it always stayed in the back of my mind. When in 2014 I started to realise project management wasn't challenging me enough, I kept coming back to the Makers Academy website, but it took me months to work up the courage to apply.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The pace of the learning is challenging for everyone - if it's wasn't, then Makers wouldn't have been pushing us hard enough. What I found most difficult was suppressing my natural competitiveness. Everyone picks up different things at different paces, and when I felt like I was slower than others around me, it was hard not to beat myself up about it. I learnt to remind myself that the aim was to learn, not to race through the material as fast as possible. Equally if I felt I did understand things that others hadn't yet got, the best thing to do was to help them. It reinforced my understanding, and I knew I could ask them when I needed it. As a cohort, we were stronger together!
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I graduated just before Christmas, so the job market was unusually slow. But I worked at Makers as an alumni helper, which was brilliant, as it forced me to keep reinforcing what I'd learnt on the course. I had a handful of interviews in January, and was offered a job as a Software Developer, after a whirlwind interview process at an exciting personal data start-up.
    - question: Where are you now working?
      answer: I'm working as the lead (and only!) iOS developer at MyGravity. I was originally hired as a Ruby developer, but after a month was asked to take over development of our iPhone and iPad apps. It was daunting at first to be using a language which is so unlike anything we covered at Makers Academy, but I loved the challenge.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: Completely! I'm in a job that keeping me thinking and learning every single day - which is priceless. I'm also working on my own start-up on the side which I would never have even considered before doing Makers Academy. The future is totally unmapped, but feeling very bright right now.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Be as sure as you can before taking the step. If it's coding, try out course like Codecademy. Even if you don't complete it (like me), pay attention to how you feel when you're coding and learning. Is it tiring, or invigorating? Could you picture yourself doing it all day? But also, don't be too afraid of taking that next step - whether that's applying to Makers Academy, or signing up for an online course. If you never give it a shot, how will you ever know?
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive, and you have to be sure you can survive without a salary for four-plus months. Run the numbers, try out living on that budget for a while, because you don't want to be panicking about paying your rent in the middle of the course. However, personally, it was the best decision I've made. It's changed my life and given me a job and prospects that I could have only of dreamt of before. I'd do it again in a shot.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was most worried about how I'd cope with the pace and the pressure - 3 months is a long time to spend cramming your brain with a whole new world of knowledge. Now, I'm proud that I got through it. For me it was really important to look after myself. It might sound small, but making sure I got 7 hours of sleep a night, some exercise everyday cycling into Makers Academy, and a fully stocked freezer of home cooked meals made a massive difference.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Life changing. And like any big change, not easy.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Treat every interview like a learning experience. For every interview that didn't get me a job, it taught me something that I used in my final one. And if it's a tech test - make you have a ready supply of tea on hand!

  cohort_month: February
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Looking for a legal job after a Law conversion course.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I already could code a little, haphazardly. Wanted to become well-enough versed in modern webdev to get a job in it.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Debugging when I had problems with Rails (at the time it seemed like a giant black box, didn't know where to start)
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Spent a few months freelancing (as needed to sort some other parts of my life out, move house etc). Then told Ruben I was ready to start a full-time job, I got an offer from econsultancy eight days after that.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would stop coding for fun if I was doing it as a career rather than a hobby, and starting finding it boring. That hasn't been a problem - if anything I enjoyed hobby-coding more for being much better at it.

  summary: Psychology Graduate to Junior Developer at usTwo
  testimonial: I received a job offer on the Monday after graduation.
  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was a fresh graduate in Psychology considering my career options. I wanted to work in tech but was worried that I was being unrealistic given my background. I was having a hard time finding companies willing to train up a complete beginner, so I was considering doing something non-technical while teaching myself how to code.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've had a strong interest in tech from a young age, although I can't claim to have a history as a hacker. I taught myself enough HTML and CSS to make simple websites, and my experience in university helping societies with their websites made me realise that this was something I really enjoyed doing.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across a promoted tweet on Twitter from way back in November 2013. I saved it and emailed it to myself, and I still have that email! It was a giant stroke of luck that I was cleaning up old mail and came across it again roughly 3 weeks before the August cohort started. I had very little time to think about it but looking back it was a no-brainer. With exactly 3 months left on my student visa at that point in time, it would probably be my only opportunity to join Makers Academy.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The intensity of the course was definitely hard at times, especially when you feel like you haven't quite grasped something but the next week and the next new concept are coming your way whether you like it or not! That said, I never felt completely out of my depth, and I knew I could count on my cohort and the coaches to help me out if I needed it.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: Graduation was amazing! We'd been working on the project non-stop for two weeks and I know all of my team were really proud of it. It was a great feeling to be able to demo it and see the audience's enthusiasm about something that we made. The week leading up to graduation was tough for me as I was torn between preparing to leave the country and simultaneously juggling job interviews. I'm really happy that it all paid off, and I received a job offer on the Monday after graduation.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: £8,000 for three months of learning is expensive. On the other hand, £8,000 is also the approximate equivalent of the salary you could be earning as a developer in the same time frame of 3 months. I can't deny that it's a big investment, and it's one you have to think through yourself. For me, the resources and learning environment at Makers Academy made it worth it.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was mostly worried that I wouldn't be able to cope with the long hours. At uni, I was used to having a few lectures a week and being left to my own devices the rest of the time. As it turns out, although you are in the building for nine to twelve hours a day, Makers Academy operates on a similar schedule. I found that time flew by when I was engrossed in coding, and it was more of a struggle to get myself to stop thinking about code.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: I learnt a lot about pushing my limits, about working well with others, about what education should be like, and I also learnt how to code along the way.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Bring a laptop and be prepared to show examples of your code on the spot. Separately, I felt a little uneasy about the number of times I said "I don't know" during my technical interview, but in line with the other advice out there, it's better to be upfront about that (and be open to what the interviewer says after that!) than to pretend you know more than you do.

    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: I found after coming out of an intensive boot camp that all you find yourself talking about is code! There are so many jobs out there in this industry so be yourself, don't pretend you're something your not otherwise you won't get the job that is right for you.

  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Before Makers Academy I was working in Commercial Management in the airline industry.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I enjoy creating things and understanding code allows you to build stuff. I had stopped learning new stuff and I've had a fantastic career but wanted to do something different.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I first became aware of Makers Academy through a promoted tweet. I then visited a couple of times (a graduation and sat in on a lecture). After seeing the awesome work that the students were capable of delivering at the end of their course and experiencing the culture I decided it would be a great environment in which to learn a new skill.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Everything and nothing! Whilst it isn't easy, the learning environment and support is great to take you through the 12 weeks.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I started looking for jobs after graduation and 10 weeks after graduating I landed a great job offer.

  summary: Website Manager to Junior Developer at Deloitte Digital
  testimonial: It was the hardest thing I've ever done and the best thing I've ever done.
  cohort_month: October
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I worked as a website manager - writing and editing some blogs and doing bits of SEO and making sure the site gained traffic.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I fell into my past career because I sort of liked writing and I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. But for the past few years I'd been finding it unfulfilling, uninspiring and couldn't see a future in it. I'd worked for tech companies and I felt that if I could start a career as a developer, I'd have a lot more opportunities open to me, including travel and freelance working.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I started to teach myself how to code, but it was much harder than I thought it would be. A lot of online tutorials either assume too much prior knowledge or just don't apply to real-world situations. I've always thrived in a classroom environment so I decided to search online for face-to-face coding courses and came across Makers Academy. Makers offered a safe environment to learn how to code and could give me the tools I needed to become a junior developer.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The pace was furious! The course covers a great deal of material and, frankly, 12 weeks is not that long! Also, my old job was not very labour intensive so the transition to Makers - working Monday to Friday from 9am till late, and weekends too, was very hard.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I had to go back to my old job as they'd very kindly given me unpaid leave to do the course. However, one day back into the old job reminded me of why I hated it so much! I decided to hand in my notice more or less straight away so that I could concentrate on finding a job as a developer. I finished work at the end of December and in mid-January secured an interview with Deloitte Digital through Makers. Two interviews and two hours later I was tentatively offered a job! I started working at Deloitte in February and I am very happy there.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I actually look forward to going to work! I feel proud of all the hard work I've put in to become a junior developer and very positive about my future career.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it. It's a scary and tough decision, but if you're unhappy in your current position, if you're feeling trapped, frustrated and you're wasting your life then you should absolutely change your career if you have the means to.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: I would say you're right, it's a lot of money, but I think the expense made me really value the course. It made me work really hard, and I'm glad I did because it has totally paid off. I'm now working for a brilliant digital company, earning more than I was before - It won't take long to earn the course fee back.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was worried that I would struggle and that I'd find the course too difficult. And it was difficult and I did struggle but I had a great deal of support from the coaches and the staff so that the workload never became too much to handle. Another great source of help and support throughout the course were the members of my cohort. Makers created a real camaraderie, we all bonded over the experience and learned from each other, and we're still good friends now.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: It was the hardest thing I've ever done and the best thing I've ever done.
    - question: What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?
      answer: Be enthusiastic and show your passion for coding. Most hirers aren't expecting top-grade developers after 12 weeks of learning to code, but they will want to see that you've learned a lot, you're willing to learn more and you'll be a great addition to their team. Although, having attended Makers, you will already be all of those things!

    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Everything. It's really hard to keep up with the course but at the same time I had a wonderful time, I've met incredible people and I would do it again and again.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: After graduation I kept coding everyday. I went over all my project on Github and studied technologies that we didn't touch during the course. I did a few technical tests and at the beginning of March I got an offer for a front-end role at Legal and General.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I've got a great job so I'm really happy and I moved to Brighton which is beautiful. A great change from being a waitress to become a developer in less than a year.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: Do it! Don't think twice.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is expensive but you need to invest in yourself to achieve what you really want.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: My biggest worry was I would not be good enough to learn to code in 12 week and that I will not find a job after the course. I however did it even if it was hard, it wasn't impossible. I found a great job so I'm very happy and i feel accomplished.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Challenging and frustrating, spending 11-12 hours per day coding, but at the same time a great experience. I had a lot of fun and met incredible people. It's something that will stay with me forever.

  summary: Newspaper Editor to Junior Developer at Zeit Online
  testimonial: Makers was three of the most empowering months of my life!
  cohort_month: April
  cohort_year: 2015
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as an editor for the local newspaper "Oberhessische Presse" in Marburg, Germany.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: By working on small blog projects I  got very obsessed by coding problems but I also knew that I wasn't actually coding but fiddling around and from my work experience I knew that I could land a way more interesting job if I knew how to code. I had unsuccessfully applied for two of those.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I think I had read about Steer.me and started Google-ing for it when I had decided to learn how to code. Makers Academy ranked better and offered something way more substantial.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: The beginning was hard. I thought I was just too stupid to get encapsulation and proper OOP done.
    - question: What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?
      answer: I came back to the guy at zeit.de who had told me a year ago that they had decided to give the job to another applicant who knew how to code. I told them what I had learned and asked him if I could work with them on a small project. The next morning he called and offered me a paid internship in research & development.
    - question: How has your life changed since graduation?
      answer: I came from a depressed industry (journalism) where graduates can't find jobs and experienced editors loose them for financial reasons. Now I have one leg up in a fast growing industry and skills even news organisations are looking for. That feels great.
    - question: What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?
      answer: If you plan to leave your old career and become a full time developer, prepare for a long and demanding but rewarding trip. If you see a way this ias a way to boost your old career with coding skills it's going to be much easier.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?
      answer: It is. If you are disciplined enough to take five months off and learn how to code with online tutorials you can save money. However, the advantage of Makers Academy is that you learn best practices like TDD from the very beginning and that you are pulled forward when you feel like staying at one topic to grasp it entirely. Which made me learn much more in three month than I would have learned on my own.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: That I would really learn how to code but I did! I am not an experienced engineer but I can understand what they are doing and I can build a whole lot of things myself.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: Three of the most empowering months of my life.

      answer: It's all relative. £8000 is a lot for three months, but it's a drop in the ocean compared to what you'll end up being able to earn throughout your career.
    - question: What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?
      answer: I was pretty sure I'd find a job eventually but I was so worried I wouldn't find one quickly enough before my savings ran out. If I'd have known I'd be so lucky and walk straight into a job I would never have worried.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience
      answer: A rollercoaster ride that can make you feel empowered and then inadequate from one day to the next - but the end goal is totally worth it.

  summary: Investment analyst to Tech Business Founder
  testimonial: Without Makers Academy, I don't think I would have been able to build the website myself
  cohort_month: December
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working in an Investment analyst.
    - question: What did you learn to code?
      answer: To be able to build the MVP for my startup and understand how things work.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: A friend of mine recommended MA among other names. I liked the programme, and the dates suited me.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Being tired all the time.
    - question: What did you choose to learn to code rather than find a technical co-founder?
      answer: Since my website is the main product of my startup, it's important to me to understand how it's built and how it works. I dont' want to have to rely entirely on someone else for the tech part of the business. I will eventually partner with a tech co-founder in the long-run, I think it's essential to have some tech knowledge in order to be able to communicate and work efficiently with my CTO/tech team.
    - question: Tell us more about your businesss?
      answer: <a href='http://.vinterior.co' target='_blank'>Vinterior</a> is an online marketplace for second-hand high-end furniture.
    - question: How do you think Makers Academy helped in setting up your tech business?
      answer: Without Makers Academy, I don't think I would have been able to build the website myself. Through Makers, I also met awesome people who helped me build the site and gave me great advice and ideas.
    - question: Are you still coding/involved in the technical side of your business?
      answer: I am finishing up in building my MVP at the moment, so yes!
    - question: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who might be considering to join Makers Academy?
      answer: If you are interested in coding and have sufficient time, money and drive to do it, you should definitely do it. But to make the most of the experience, you should be ready to put a lot of time and effort. It would be a plus for entrepreneurs to have an idea of the technologies they would use, so that they can focus their learning on these languages. Another advantage of Makers is access to the tech industry and a growing network of alumni.

  summary: Digital Brand Director to Founder of peg.co
  testimonial: Makers Academy gave me the knowledge I needed to build our MVP and I found my two Co-Founders there.
  cohort_month: August
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I was working as the Digital Brand Director at Syco Entertainment/Sony Music.
    - question: Why did you learn to code?
      answer: I learned to code so I could build prototypes, manage developers and understand the world we live in.
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across Makers Academy on Google. The phrase "Oxford vs the marines but for coders" is what sold it to me. I think you have to be somewhat unhinged to pay a lot of money for three months of torture - so that sentence did a good job of filtering out the sane people and only attracting the loons.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Confidence. Generally I'm fairly good at picking up new skills, but coding I really struggled with. Feeling stupid has to be one of the biggest confidence killers.
    - question: Why did you choose to learn to code rather than go and find a technical co-founder??
      answer: An old mentor of mine always told me how important it is as CEO to understand everything about your business. You can't just hire an accountant and not take the time to understand the company accounts yourself, so why would you not take the time to understand your own product which is the foundation of your entire business?
    - question: Tell us more about your business?
      answer: We build software that helps brands collaborate with highly influential YouTubers. You can see more at <a href='http://peg.co' target='_blank'>peg.co</a>.
    - question: How do you think Makers Academy helped in setting up your tech business?
      answer: It gave me the knowledge I needed to build our MVP and I found my two Co-Founders there.
    - question: Have you raised? If so how much and from where?
      answer: Yes - we're closing right now. It's in the region of £325k at a post-valuation of about £2.6m. All angel investors.
    - question: Are you still coding/involved in the technical side of your business?
      answer: A bit. I still build prototypes for new features/product ideas but generally don't touch much production code.
    - question: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who might be considering to join Makers Academy?
      answer: Do it. I believe that understanding how to code is as important now (if not more so) than learning maths and science at school. Tech entirely surrounds us in the world we live in. Why would you not want to have an understanding of that? And if you're planning on building a tech company it's an absolute no brainer.

  summary: Finance to Founder of AirSorted
  testimonial: Join Makers Academy if you want to know tech speak but also if you are looking for a good backup plan, should you not succeed!
  cohort_month: December
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: I worked on Wall St and in the City for Deutsche Bank and UBS.
    - question: Why did you learn to code?
      answer: I learnt to code because I wanted to build my own MVPs but I learnt so much more than that. It got me hosting on Airbnb and I learnt a lot from the Founders about the Lean Startup. Most of all though, it allowed me to understand what coders are saying!
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I came across Makers while exploring an escape from finance and thought it was for me, very quickly! I met with the team and then I was certain.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Nothing. It was easy! - The truth? Almost everything, the nature of coding is that you have to understand lots of concepts all at once. It is hard to keep track!
    - question: Why did you choose to learn to code rather than go and find a technical co-founder??
      answer: I did find a technical co-founder! James who taught at Makers and left during the time I was there.
    - question: Tell us more about your business?
      answer: <a href='http://airsorted.uk' target='_blank'>AirSorted</a> makes Airbnb Hassle-free for host. We provide an Airbnb management solution that allows hosts to sit back, without worry. We handle the cleaning, laundry, keys as well as pricing and communication!
    - question: How do you think Makers Academy helped in setting up your tech business?
      answer: Apart from meeting an amazing developer, it taught me how to talk "code". I know what an API is, I can imagine how software might do the things the business needs. It was invaluable!
    - question: Have you raised? If so how much and from where?
      answer: Yes we have raised money from Pi Labs and we are invested in by James Caan, who invests in Pi Labs.
    - question: Are you still coding/involved in the technical side of your business?
      answer: Not very much, but I still understand what the CTO means when he is "talking code".
    - question: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who might be considering to join Makers Academy?
      answer: Join if you want to know tech speak but also if you are looking for a good backup plan, should you not succeed!

  summary: Management Director to Translation Technology Startup Entrepreneur
  testimonial: " Makers Academy was the twelve most intense, insanely challenging and rewarding weeks of my life!"
  cohort_month: December
  cohort_year: 2014
  case_study:
    - question: What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?
      answer: Until July 2014, I was MD of a translation agency which I tried to acquire. The deal eventually fell through after 12 months and I left the business to ponder about what I should do with my career from there. Having fallen out of love with the industry, I knew that I would have to do something radically different that would retain my interest.
    - question: What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?
      answer: I've had an obsession with technology from a very young age. I loved computer games and later computers. My mum and step dad had both worked in software sales at one point or another which is how I started to see tech as a fun way to make money. During my time in the translation industry, I sold and implemented technologies for enterprise but none of the products that was on the market really turned me on. I wanted to gain the power to build my own stuff. Being able to code gives you the tools to turn your ideas in to a tangible thing that people can interact with. How cool is that?
    - question: How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?
      answer: I had previously met Evgeny at a couple of London startup events and he told me about Makers. I won't lie, I was sceptical as maths and physics were probably my weakest subjects at school. I also could not see a way to take three months out of my career to make it happen so I parked the idea. Since I was 'taking a break' from August 2014, I decided it was now or never and so I finally bit the bullet and sent in my application.
    - question: What did you find difficult during the course?
      answer: Everything! To some extent, my suspicions about my natural ability to code were confirmed when I struggled with some of the core concepts. I am extremely impatient and coding, especially debugging requires a huge amount of patience. Initially, I also found myself competing against my peers as I have a very competitive nature. It felt very unsettling to suddenly be in an environment where I was not top of the class. Although it got easier with time, I would say that I was deeply humbled by the whole experience.
    - question: What happened during / after graduation?
      answer:  I decided not to take a break and threw myself in to my new project. I am currently working on scoping my MVP (Minimum Valuable Product) I also worked out a lot to shift the extra stone I gained during the course. It seems that coding can make you fat! I then however got accepeted onto <a href='http://www.joinef.com/' target='_blank'>entrepreneur first</a> as one of only 3 women on the cohort of 34 and they had more than 5k applicants.
    - question: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who might be considering to join Makers Academy?
      answer: Definitely do it if you plan to start a tech business! You should learn to code because you can't sail a ship unless you know how that ship works. It also does not hurt to develop empathy with your team and the process for developing amazing products. Learning what bullshit smells like removes a layer of doubt and vulnerability for a founder who is hiring. That said, I believe very strongly in the importance of a founding team. I am now able to build a MVP to show to potential co-founders which makes my venture a more attractive proposition.
    - question: How has learning to code help you become a better entrepreneur?
      answer:  I am better equipped to make some initial technology decisions myself and am empowered to start building something without depending on others. The thought of outsourcing to a dev shop or freelancer always filled me with dread because I would have had no idea what bad looks like.
    - question: What would you say to people who say £8000 is very expensive?
      answer: Depends how you look at it. For most people (including myself), 8k is a lot of money. The cost is actually much higher than that if you take in to account living expenses, loss of earnings etc. In my opinion, I think that the course is excellent value for the money you pay. That does not make it inexpensive but it means that you definitely get what you pay for. If anyone is unsure, they just need to look at the quality of the <a href='http://beta.makersacademy.com/graduates' target='_blank'>final projects.</a>.
    - question: Sum up your Makers Academy experience?
      answer: The twelve most intense, insanely challenging and rewarding weeks of my life!
